            Born in Singapore, Hecha 4000 was founded in 1996 with a vision: to make high-quality, artisanal freshly brewed teas accessible to everyone: the masses and even the picky tea enthusiasts. Built with careful deliberation and meticulousness with every sip, Hecha 4000 is handcrafted by the best of the best artisanal tea masters from Taiwan, China and Japan with over fifty years of tea brewing experience. Hecha 4000 derives its artisanal tea leaves from our very own tea mountain in Kaohsiung, with our very own professional tea tasters and tea roasters.<br><br>
            Our state-of-the-art milk tea is made by adding organic, non-genetically modified artisanal fruit syrup and milk to the finest cold-pressed tea, which is brewed on the spot every fifteen minutes. Our chewy balls or “pearls” are made of the finest grade of tapioca, hand pressed to form into chewy, delectable delights which make it a top customer favourite giving. Our extra-large straws that go with the balls when drinking the beverage are revolutionary. They are made out of 100% recycled artisanal paper, and are fully biodegradable. The “bubble”, patented by Hecha 4000, refers to the froth created by shaking the drink to fully incorporate our artisanal teas with state-of-the-art organic milk from Hokkaido. We serve a wide variety of teas, including customer favourites such as our ever-popular Dingdong Oolong. We also listen to your feedback and brought back Matcha, a fan favourite. One can order the teas plain or add a wide variety of other toppings and selections. Customers also have the option of adjusting the drink’s sugar level. We also provide customers with signature blends that have been fine-tuned by our tea connoisseurs to deliver the best overall taste at a stunning value.

            We take huge pride in our tea, much like how a particular Drumpf takes huge pride in proclaiming an election victory despite missing key states that have yet to be accounted for. However, we pride in making our tea great for you. Everything we do to make our products delectable is because of you: the picky, the demanding, the hopeful or the mischievous. We understand that many bubble tea lovers are tired of the low quality that bubble tea chains used to offer, such as artificial colourings and flavourings, tapioca pearls that actually are not tapioca, you know it. Hence, Hecha 4000 set out on a journey to deliver state-of-the-art teas to cure the disease, that is low quality bubble teas.<br><br>
            Much like how wearing a mask in today’s world is a public health and safety measure, Hecha 4000 believes that improving the everyday health and well-being of bubble tea lovers starts with a cup of fresh, organic artisanal tea leaves. The result from such a brew derives up to 80% more flavour than standard leaves. However, we do not just stop at the tea. Every single topping or add-on to your beverage has also been carefully considered. We do not endorse any covfefe in our drinks, but you can most certainly include toppings such as our chewy pearls made with the finest organic tapioca grown in the Taiwanese Highlands. Each process in the making of each Hecha 4000 beverage has been carefully considered and crafted, all because of you.
